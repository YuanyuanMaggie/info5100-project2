      <p>As graduation approaches, every Cornell senior has an important decision to make: which job to pick. With graduation coming up in May, we thought we could take this opportunity to delve deeper into what Cornell students have received as their starting salaries as they step out into the real world. We hope this visualization helps graduating seniors students in their decision making process about potential job opportunities.
The starting salary data was collected from Cornell Career Services’ website published in the form of Postgraduate Reports (1). This data was published in PDF form by year starting from 2000. One of our lovely team members took the trouble of extracting this relevant information from 16 different PDFs and converted it into a form that was more user-friendly, like a CSV file (we did try to contact Cornell Career Services for raw data, but to no luck). While the PDFs contained a substantial amount of data, we focused on a subset of it that we thought were key aspects a student considers in making decisions about a job. 
Our subset included data indicative of starting salary by year, college, and the location of the jobs students pursued after graduating for years between 2001-2014 as this was the subset with complete information in all of the three categories we selected. This data was used exactly in the form it was retrieved from the source. This specific data source limited what we could do with our visualization. As this data was only published by regions, the state version of the map is not as effective of a visualization as we would have liked it to be. 
Another key aspect one should consider while evaluating an offer not contained within the Career Services data was cost of living of the various locations young Cornell alumni pursued jobs in. We found Cost of Living Index data from (2). However, this data only contained the most recent year, 2015. Thus, we used data and calculated this index for 2001-2014 by using inflation data taken from (3). In order to help the user understand this Cost of Living Index with ease, we used it to adjust the starting salary data so the viewer would know how much money he/she would actually have after cost of living adjustments were made. This was done by dividing the the starting salary by the index. For this calculation, the index was represented as a percentage. 
Our third data source was salary per capita of each of the states in the US from 2001 - 2014. This information was taken from (4) and used in the same form. Another data source we included was that of rent (7). Since rent is something a typical graduating senior would have to spend on, we included this information for the viewer to make a direct comparison. This data also had to be converted into a user-friendly format since it was only available for each state separately as HTML and was done by another of of our lovely team members. 
While we considered condensing this data into the regions as specified in the Cornell Career Services data, we thought it would be more beneficial to picture this data by state as well for individuals who would be considering a more direct state by state comparison. In addition, the region comparison would mask certain aspects only visible in the state-by-state comparison. The conversion from region to state was handled dynamically through d3 after specifying the states that fell within a region.
In addition, we included reference data such as the cost of a four year undergraduate program at Cornell over the years to make the return on this investment clear to the end user. An assumption we made when calculating four year tuition was that it would be capped for the duration of one’s degree. That is, if an incoming first year paid a certain amount in tuition for the first year, we assumed there would be no change for the remaining three years of the degree. 
The tuition information is also shown in a different way - the number of years it would take to pay back a loan that financed an undergraduate’s Cornell career in a given year based on tuition costs for the year got from (5) and student loan interest rate estimate taken from (6). This calculation was done using the following formula:
Number of years = - log (1 - rate * Principal Loan AmountAnnual Payment) log (1 + annual rate)</p>

<p>Another simplifying assumption made was that of the loan amount. The principal loan amount was assumed to be one to cover the total tuition amount for four years (excluding housing, food and other expenses). We understand that in reality, not everyone would take out a loan for the whole amount.
Since we had a fairly small (and extremely limited) dataset to work with, a substantial amount of integration was done through Excel. This proved to be useful as we could filter the data with ease and visualize it effectively while brainstorming ideas to come up with our final visualization. We also used Excel to combine and normalize all of the different datasets. However, calculations related to loan repayment years were handled directly in d3.
Our visualization is divided into two main parts, the four maps and the trend line along with the histogram respectively. The timeline shows Cornell’s Starting Salary information in a different perspective. That is, by the different colleges. Presenting the data in this zoomed out form helps identify trends not immediately visible in the maps above.</p>

<p>For the maps, we used d3, topojson and colorbrewer to effectively display the four heat maps. Our code reads the topojson file to draw respective state. It is also notable that we needed our topojson to contain regions as well as states. To do this, we started with state shapefile, opened it in QGIS and added the region to each state.  Then exported that shapefile, and following Mike Bostock’s “Let’s Make a Map Tutorial” to convert it to geojson and then topojson with the appropriate properties. Since Cornell’s salary data did not include Hawaii and Alaska, we removed these states from the original shapefile before converting it to topojson. 
The fill color on the maps on each of the respective maps changes depending on the four measures: Cornell’s starting salary, housing (rental) costs, cost of indices, and salary per capita using data by contained in the dataByState csv file. Similarly, once regions were defined in our code, we used the data not contained within the state version of the csv from dataByRegion csv file. In addition, for the four heat maps, the scale was not predefined by us. We specified the number of categories (or buckets) we wanted the data to have through trial and error and the division was handled dynamically via d3. In the end, we chose 9, 9, 6 and 5 for the four maps respectively.  We used colorbrewer.js for the color scales. 
The data for the timeline of starting salary by college was transformed using a log scale. The colors we used for this, as well as the bar chart, are those within d3’s built-in category10 ordinal scale. We added tuition to this timeline for comparison purposes. For the histogram/bar chart depicting the number of years it would take to pay back a loan, we used ordinal and linear scales to depict colleges along the x-axis and years along the y-axis for the bar chart. The timeline and barchart, both, are interactive. For example, the bar chart will update if you hover over a particular year in the timeline or you change the percent of the starting salary paid on the loan. For these interactions, both the number of years to pay off the loan and the monthly amount paid on the load is calculated dynamically and the bar chart reflects these changes.
While it is clear what our final visualization looks like, it is important to note that we tried various permutations and combinations of how we display the data before we came up with our final product. Our initial prototype did include a timeline of salaries through the years to make the trend seen in the first map more obvious, but it had limitations due to the nature of the data from Cornell Career Services as well as how challenging it would be for a user to connect two visuals that would not be on the same viewport for the user.
By exploring this visualization, we hope a senior on the brink of stepping into the real world is empowered to evaluate a job offer appropriately based on key aspects we’ve shown through this visualization. For example, a higher paying job in the West may not necessarily mean a better quality of life in comparison to the lower paying job in the Midwest. That is, salary is not the end of the story. Cost of living takes into consideration an important aspects that individuals may not typically consider. Thus, the money one receives in hand is substantially different from the salary one is paid. It is important to think about these vital pieces of information in order to make a well informed choice that will set the stage for one’s career. In addition presenting the years it would take to pay a tuition loan as a fraction of one’s salary portrays that while most of Cornell’s undergraduate students pay the same for a 4 year degree (except for New York State residents), not all the colleges have the same return on this investment, and it is important to keep this in mind while deciding between job offers or evaluating one. For individuals who want to dig into the visual a little deeper, we hope they can use this tool to be more confident when negotiating their offers based on the trend shown in over the years apart from the cost of living in a certain state.</p>
